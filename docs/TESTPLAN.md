# Test plan for this add-on

## Manual / QA TEST Instructions

### Expected User Experience / Functionality

The add-on modifies certain preferences that affect how often and which messages from the messaging system are displayed.

For the sake of testing this add-on however, it is enough to verify that the add-on has modified the relevant preferences.

### Surveys

No surveys are fired by this add-on.

### Preparations

- Download a Pre-Release version of Firefox (Firefox Developer Edition or Nightly)
- (Create profile: <https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox/Multiple_profiles>, or via some other method)

### Using the Remote Settings development server

Until the experiment-specific remote settings buckets (`cfr-ml-control`, `cfr-ml-experiments` and `cfr-ml-models`) are provisioned in a live environment, we use the Remote Settings development server when testing the add-on:

- Check existing Remote Settings development server contents using:

```
curl https://kinto.dev.mozaws.net/v1//buckets/main/collections/cfr-ml-control/records
curl https://kinto.dev.mozaws.net/v1//buckets/main/collections/cfr-ml-experiments/records
curl https://kinto.dev.mozaws.net/v1//buckets/main/collections/cfr-ml-models/records
```

- If there is no data to be found, run [this script](../seed-remote-settings-dev-server.sh) in a terminal (has to be run once each day the add-on is to be tested since the development server is reset every 24h)
- Start firefox
- Add if not exists and set the `services.settings.server` preference to `https://kinto.dev.mozaws.net/v1`
- Install the Remote Settings Devtools add-on (Go to https://github.com/mozilla/remote-settings-devtools/releases and install directly from the `remote-settings-devtools@mozilla.com-1.2.0-signed.xpi` release link).
- Click the rightmost green puzzle icon to visit the Remote Settings Devtools.
- Verify that the collections `cfr-ml-control`, `cfr-ml-experiments` and `cfr-ml-models` are listed in the Remote Settings Devtools UI
- Verify that some sort of messages are listed when clicking on each model in the Remote Settings Devtools UI

### Enroll in the study and install the add-on

Either install the add-on using a Normandy server or follow the following steps:

- Open the browser console using Firefox's top menu at `Tools > Web Developer > Browser Console`
- Go into DevTools -> Settings (F1) and enable the checkbox for "Enable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes"
- Based on the variant that is being tested (control or treatment), run one of the following in the Browser Console:

Treatment:

```js
const { AddonStudies } = ChromeUtils.import(
  "resource://normandy/lib/AddonStudies.jsm",
);
await AddonStudies.add({
  recipeId: 42,
  slug: "messaging-system-personalization-experiment-1-addon",
  userFacingName: "Messaging System Personalization Experiment 1",
  userFacingDescription: "messaging-system-personalization-experiment-1-addon",
  branch: "treatment",
  active: true,
  addonId:
    "messaging-system-personalization-experiment-1-addon-treatment@mozilla.org",
  addonUrl:
    "https://example.com/messaging-system-personalization-experiment-1-addon-treatment@mozilla.org-foo.xpi",
  addonVersion: "0.0.0",
  extensionApiId: 1,
  extensionHash: "badhash",
  hashAlgorithm: "sha256",
  studyStartDate: "2019-11-26T07:00:09.991Z",
  studyEndDate: null,
});
```

Control:

```js
const { AddonStudies } = ChromeUtils.import(
  "resource://normandy/lib/AddonStudies.jsm",
);
await AddonStudies.add({
  recipeId: 42,
  slug: "messaging-system-personalization-experiment-1-addon",
  userFacingName: "Messaging System Personalization Experiment 1",
  userFacingDescription: "messaging-system-personalization-experiment-1-addon",
  branch: "control",
  active: true,
  addonId:
    "messaging-system-personalization-experiment-1-addon-control@mozilla.org",
  addonUrl:
    "https://example.com/messaging-system-personalization-experiment-1-addon-control@mozilla.org-foo.xpi",
  addonVersion: "0.0.0",
  extensionApiId: 1,
  extensionHash: "badhash",
  hashAlgorithm: "sha256",
  studyStartDate: "2019-11-26T07:05:55.772Z",
  studyEndDate: null,
});
```

- Go to [this experiment's feature bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1594422) and note which is the latest set of add-on xpi files
- If the tested add-on is signed with the testing certificate set the following pref:
  - Have the "xpinstall.signatures.required" boolean pref to "false".
  - Have the "xpinstall.signatures.dev-root" boolean pref created with the "true" value.
- If the tested add-on is not signed
  - Have the "extensions.legacy.enabled" boolean pref created with the "true" value.
- Install either the latest `control` or `treatment` add-on xpi file

**Being offline should not unenroll the user from the study - Test 1**

- Install a signed add-on as per above
- Verify that the study runs
- Go offline
- Restart Firefox
- Verify that the user is not unenrolled due to network connectivity issues (error output in the Add-on Toolbox Console is expected)
- Go online
- Verify that the periodic polling and score computation works again

**Being offline should not unenroll the user from the study - Test 2**

- Download a signed add-on as per above
- Go offline
- Install the signed add-on
- Verify that the study runs
- Verify that the user is not unenrolled due to network connectivity issues (error output in the Add-on Toolbox Console is expected)
- Go online
- Verify that the periodic polling and score computation works again

**Not showing in `about:addons`**

- Install a signed add-on as per above
- Verify that the study runs
- Verify that the study does not show up in `about:addons` (note: only signed study add-ons are hidden)

**Cleans up preferences upon Normandy unenrollment**

- Enroll a client using the Normandy staging server
- Verify that the study runs
- Verify that `browser.messaging-system.personalized-cfr.score-threshold` has a non-default value
- Unenroll a client using the Normandy staging server
- Verify that the `browser.messaging-system.personalized-cfr.score-threshold` preference is empty or does not exist
- Verify that the `browser.messaging-system.personalized-cfr.scores` preference is empty or does not exist
- Verify that the `browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.providers.cfr` preference has a `bucket` attribute with a value of `cfr`, no `cohort` attribute (or at least not one that starts with `PERSONALIZATION_EXPERIMENT_1_`), no `personalized` attribute and no `personalizedModelVersion` attribute.

Note: To test this without a Normandy staging server, make sure that you have run `AddonStudies.add(....)` in the browser console, then open the `Inspect` toolbox next to the add-on in `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, and in that console run `await browser.normandyAddonStudy.endStudy("FOO");`. The toolbox will crash as the add-on gets uninstalled, but you will be able to verify the effects by checking the pref values.

## Debug

To see the log output from the add-on, go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and click `Inspect` next to the add-on, then switch to the Console tab. Note that this only works for unsigned builds of the add-on, since the signed builds will not show up here.
